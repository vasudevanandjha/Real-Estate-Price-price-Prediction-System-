# Real-Estate-Price-price-Prediction-System-
I have developed this project in my 2nd year of internship in which I predicted the price using several python libraries like numpy, panda, mathplotlib, sklearn. I have compared several algorithms (lasso, linear, decision Tree) in the dataset
Hello! 
Vasudeva nand Jha here
This is a data scinece project in my 2nd year internship where I have predicted the price of the real estate
I have used Pyhton Libraries such as numpy pandas, mathplotlib, sklearn
I have compared three algorithms 1) lasso, 2) linear, 3) decision tree in which linear regresssion gave more accurate values.
